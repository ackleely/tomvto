# TOMVTO: A WEB-BASED APPLICATION UTILIZING AN IMAGE-BASED DEEP LEARNING APPROACH IN CLASSIFYING AND PREDICTING TOMATO SEEDS VIABILITY
The purpose of the website was to solve the problem of minimizing the waste of resources by developing a system that can make an initial prediction on the viability of tomato seeds. By utilizing the advanced deep learning models, the challenges present in the traditional method of farming can be prevented.

# Problem
The country Filipinos live in, the Philippines, relies on crop production due to the terrain and tropical climate conditions. It is considered an agricultural country, with its cultured crops being the top export products (Balita, 2025). In terms of vegetables, tomatoes are one of the most cultivated. However, there is a challenge that farmers face, and it is the incapability in the production of tomatoes to tell accurately prior to planting if the tomato seeds will germinate (Data et al., 2020). This contributes to waste of resources, low percentage of yields, and negatively impacts income and the quality of food (Scientist et al., 2024). The proposed idea is to develop a web-based application, “TomVto: A Web-Based Application Utilizing an Image-Based Deep Learning Approach in Classifying and Predicting Tomato Seed Viability,” aiming to create a tool for assessing seed viability. 

# Objectives
The main objective of this study is to develop a web-based application mainly to use for the classification and prediction of the seed’s viability using an image-based deep learning approach and evaluate its effectiveness in helping tomato farmers, agricultural agencies, and new researchers.
